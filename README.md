# EMS-tidy-codes
codes for EMS proceedings publication, 2025

This material is part of the shared research about air-sea interactions in a high-resolution coupled simulation which appears in a EMS Proceedings paper, which to date is to be published in mid 2025 (doi will be published as soon as the paper will be accepted).
I am collecting the codes to recreate the figures which appear in the article and the functions to compute and evaluate linear regressions.

- functions_collection.py : small library containing all the statistical functions needed to recreate our analysis
- new_template.ipynb : template Python notebook with step-by-step construction of our computations to quickly re-create our figures --> the only thing missing is data loading, which is left to the interested recipient (contact Carlos Conejero)
